# Root-Finding-Functions

There are three types of root finding applied in this code: Bisection Method, Newton's Method, and Secant Method. 

You will need to manually type in the function you are finding roots for along with its first derivative.

Notes for each method:
1. Bisection Method:
* You need to make sure the root you are trying to find lies between the two points given and also in a reasonable domain.
2. Newton's Method: 
* This will require use of the first derivative.
3. Secant Method:
* This requires entering two x values. If values are not in correct domain, may not converge.
